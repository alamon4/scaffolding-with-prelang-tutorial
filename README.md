Scaffolding Rails Apps with Prelang Tutorial
=================================

Prelang is a generating tool made by [Erik Nomitch](https://github.com/eriknomitch) for Rails Applications. It's awesomely powerful and my choice for Rails scaffolding. Check out the [tutorial](tutorial.md) or give a try yourself on [Prelang](https://prelang.com/).

A tutorial designed for SLP students, but can be applied elsewhere.
